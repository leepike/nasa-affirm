1. OK.

2. Looks good

3. Looks good

4. Rephrasing sounds great

5. Rephrase as: "This way, both horizontal propagation of faults (e.g., the
earlier CRC propagation) and vertical propagation of faults (e.g.,
self-checking hardware) can be modeled in the ADSL as components embedded in
other components.

6. Add a reference to Figures 8 to the sentence on page 9 beginning:
"Auto-generated code like that shown in Fig. 10 is only ... " so that it
reads: "Auto-generated code like that shown in Figures 8 and 10 are only ..."

To the end of the first paragraph of page 14, add the sentence:
"Such an event calendar is synthesised automatically by LIMA from a handler
like the generic example specified in Figure 13."

7. This whole paragraph was supposed to be a direct quote attributed to John
Rushby from his "SAL Tutorial" paper [54]. In the last version of the paper we
uploaded, this appeared as a block quote on page 33.

8. "Fast Majority Vote" is the name of the algorithm. The sentence
appears correct as is.

9. Combine the first two sentences as follows:
"The formal model generated for OM(1) by LIMA is quite large compared to the
input specification: the LIMA input is 5,632 bytes compares to
the the formal model (Sally input format) which is 110,581 bytes."

10. Rephrase to:
"The channel in control is also simplified to a fixed-priority scheme ..."

11. Rephrase to:
"The specification starts with a top-level atom called "wbs" (standing for
wheel brake system) that is used to host ..."

12. Ref. 1 author is Dvorak D. only.
    Ref 75  author is Jones S.P. only.

We also noticed that in Ref. 76 there is a ~ character missing from the URL.
It should be: https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~lepike/pub_pages/ivory.html

Also, the URL in Ref. 80 looks malformed. The correct URL is:
https://www.mathworks.com/tagteam/74250_Paper%20Number%2012AEAS-0090-finalweb.pdf

13. Addition reference details:
