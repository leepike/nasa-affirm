\subsection{Asynchronous  Airbus A320 Autobrake System}
\label{airbuscs}

\subsubsection{Informal Description}

The third  case-study is based on the runway excursion of an Airbus 320, occurring on
an Ibiza Airbus on 21st of May, 1998.  The full details of and the root cause
analysis are detailed in the incident report~\cite{a320ibiza}.  The excursion
resulted from a total loss of the braking system, due to the simultaneous
failure of  both channels of the Brake System Control Unit (BSCU) in conjunction
with a contamination within the braking system hydraulic system. From the ADSL
perspective, it is the failure of the software and BSCU architecture that is of
primary interest.

\end{figure}

In the A320 system as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:BSCU_schematic} from~\cite{a320ibiza}, the BSCU comprises two channels, with each channel incorporating command and monitor lanes.  The command lane provides the active
control path to the system, whereas the monitor lane checks and enforces that
the command lane is operating within the expected envelope of performance. On
the detection of the first failure, the monitoring lane indicates a failure, and
control is passed to the other channel.  All processing of the system is
executed using a quasi-synchronous computational model. That is to say,
processing of each channel is quasi-synchronous with respect to one another,
and the channels themselves are also quasi-synchronous.

In the Ibiza incident, the root cause of the loss of normal and alternative
braking systems, was the Byzantine induced failure of both BSCU channels. The
failure was due to the sampling of the auto-brake mode control input panel
buttons. The auto-brake panel comprise three buttons, \texttt{LO}, \texttt{MED} and \texttt{MAX} that can
be used to select the corresponding auto-braking mode.  Momentarily pushing the
\texttt{LO} button selects the \texttt{LO} auto-braking mode. Pressing \texttt{LO} again de-selects the
auto-braking function, whereas pressing the \texttt{MED} or \texttt{MAX} buttons  selects the
corresponding automatic braking  modes. The state of the selected mode is
communicated to the crew by indicators for each mode that are illuminated when
the corresponding mode is active.

In the Airbus implementation, the buttons were sampled periodically by software
every 25ms. Given the asynchronous composition of the system, each processor
samples the button state relative to its own operating time-line. This
implementation is vulnerable to short button presses that are too short ($< 25$ms)
and therefore not consistently perceived by all of the sampling units as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:push_button_sampling}.
(Additional inter-lane mode agreement logic, to mitigate Byzantine sampling is
not implemented in the system~\footnote{Given that the command and monitor lanes
  are configured to be a fault-set, best practice would have implemented ingress
  agreement logic to prevent a fault external to the pair from disrupting the
  paired agreement.}.) Hence, the system failure occurred when the command and
monitoring lanes of both channels fell into disagreement, following the momentary 
selection of the \texttt{LO} auto-brake mode. The \texttt{LO} selection was only detected by one
of the lanes of each channel, hence the command and monitor mode disagreement
detection logic was erroneously stimulated. In the excursion, the disagreement
occurred on both channels simultaneously. Given that the system mode logic was
also event driven, there was no path to recovery. Pressing \texttt{LO} would be subject
to the same Byzantine vulnerability, and even if not Byzantine, the
incrementally edge driven mode selection logic would not recover into a
consistent state.

 The design errors represent a failure uncovered by the traditional design assurance
 framework.  Given the correct-by-construction synthesis focus, it is unlikely
 that our approach would allow such an implementation to be developed.  However,
 ensuring that the formal synthesis framework is sufficient to represent and
 explore such design vulnerabilities is a good test case for the ADSL formal
 tooling.  The A320 Airbus brake system offers a good case-study in asynchronous system design and verification. For example, the system also
 requires a protocol to manage the channel in control, and additional logic and
 protocols to that communication is healthy.  From the incident report these
 details of the Airbus protocol implementations in these areas are not
 available. From the description it appears that the channel-in-control logic
 utilizes an asymmetric power-on timeout to yield a first-up channel in
 control. This may also leave the system vulnerable to assumptions of BSCU
 power-on order, and transient recovery strategies.  The protocols may also be
 vulnerable to failures of the inter-lane and inter-channel communication lines.
  Utilizing the provisions within the LIMA\ workbench, the long-term goal
of this case-study is to support the systematic exploration of candidate
protocols and fault models; yielding a better understanding how protocol
and communication architecture related design decisions impact core-system
properties.
