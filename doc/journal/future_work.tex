We have laid out a vision in this technical report for an architectural domain
specific language and associated tools. Our work is heavily driven by
real-world case-studies, which we have covered in depth. We hope to convince
the reader that there is an industrial need for simplifying the specification
and verification of distributed fault-tolerant systems and for connecting
specifications to their implementations. We have described related work toward
this end, as well as our work in building the underlying constructs to support
a language and modeling framework. Much of our focus has been on the
specification and verification aspects, as we believe that formal proof is
necessary for tedious, high-consequence systems.

Although we have promising results and worked case-studies, the future work
associated with the research agenda involves significant engineering
work which we hope to address in coming years. This includes both developing the
modeling workbench itself as well as fleshing out more substantial case-studies.
