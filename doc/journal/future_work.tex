We have laid out a vision in this technical report for an architectural DSL (ADSL)  and the associated tools. Our work is heavily driven by real-world case-studies, which we have covered in depth. If anything, we hope to convince the reader that there is an industrial need for simplifying the specification and verification of distributed fault-tolerant systems, and for connecting specifications to their implementations. We have described related work toward this end, as well as our work in building the underlying constructs to support an ADSL. Much of our focus has been on the specification and verification aspects, as we believe that formal proof is necessary for tedious, high-consequence systems.

Although we have promising results and worked case-studies, the future work associated with the research agenda laid out involves significant engineering work we hope to address in coming years. This includes both developing the ADSL workbench itself as well as fleshing out more substantial case-studies.
